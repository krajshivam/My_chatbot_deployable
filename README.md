## How It Works


User types message
        ↓
Message added to conversation history
        ↓
Full history sent to Groq API (Llama 3.3)
        ↓
AI reply added to history
        ↓
Response displayed in chat UI


The conversation history is maintained in `st.session_state` — this gives the AI memory across turns without any database.
